## Introduction
- **IDOR** - Insecure Direct Object Reference
- IDOR vulnerability is when changing some id value will display another user's information.
- Example: `https://onlinestore.thm/order/1000/invoice` if the value 1000 is changed to another value then it will display the invoice of the corresponding user.

## Encoded IDs
- IDs can also be encoded instead of referring it directly.
- Base64 is the most commonly used encoding format in websites.
- Instead of `1000` the encoded value `MTAwMA==` can be used.
- Below website can help in encoding and decoding values.

## Hashed IDs
- Hashed ids are little more complicated than encoded ids.
- In md5 hashing, the id `123` would become `202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70`.
- Below websites can help in finding the value for hashes.

## Unpredictable IDs
- An excellent method of IDOR detection is to create two accounts and swap the Id numbers between them. 
- If you can view the other users' content using their Id number while still being logged in with a different account (or not logged in at all), you've found a valid IDOR vulnerability.


## Where are IDORs Located?
- The vulnerable endpoint you're targeting may not always be something you see in the address bar. 
- It could be content your browser loads in via an AJAX request or something that you find referenced in a JavaScript file.
- For example: `/user/details?user_id=123`.

Note: Select the request in developer tools and select the option `Copy as curl`.
