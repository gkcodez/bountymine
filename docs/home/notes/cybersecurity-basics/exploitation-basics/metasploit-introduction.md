## Introduction
- Metasploit is the widely used exploitation framework.
- Metasploit has two main versions.
    - Metasploit Pro - Commercial version, Supports automation, Has GUI.
    - Metasploit Framework - Opensource, Commandline only.
- Metasploit allows information gathering, scanning, exploit development, exploitation, post-exploitation, etc.
- Main components of metasploit are
    - **msfconsole** - Main command line interface.
    - **Modules** - Supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
    - **Tools** - Standalone tools such as msfvenom, pattern_create, pattern_offset, etc.
- Few important things to know are
    - **Exploit**: Piece of code that uses the vulnerability present in the target system.
    - **Vulnerability** - Design, code or logic flaw in the target system which could be exploited.
    - **Payload** - Payload is the code which runs on the target system. The payload will be used by the exploit to take advantage of the vulnerability to achieve the result that attacker wants.

## Auxilary
- Supporting module such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers.
- Found in path `/opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules/auxilary`.

## Encoders
- Encodes the payload.
- Encoders have limited success rates as antivirus solutions perform additional checks.
- Found in path `/opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules/encoders`.

## Evasion
- Evasion module are used for evading antivirus programs with more success rates.
- Found in path `/opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules/evasion`.

## Exploits
- Exploits neatly organized in the system.
- Found in path `/opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules/exploits`.

## NOPs
- No Operations (NOPs) do nothing.
- They are represented in the Intel x86 family with `0x90`.
- They are used as buffer to achieve constant payload sizes.
- Found in path `/opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules/nops`.

## Payloads
- Payloads are codes that run in the system.
- Found in path `/opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules/payloads`.
- Payloads are further divided into 4 categories.
    - Adapters - Wraps a single payload to convert it into a different format.
    - Singles - Self contained payloads.
    - Stagers - Responsible for setting up a connection between metasploit and target system. Staged payload will first upload a stager in the target machine and then download the rest of the payload(Stage).
    - Stages - Downloaded by stager.
- In metasploit, single payloads have `_` after shell keyword and staged payload have `/` after shell keyword.
    - Single payload: `generic/shell_reverse_tcp`.
    - Staged payload: `windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp`.

## Post exploitation
- Useful after exploitation.
- Found in path `/opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules/post`.

## Msfconsole
- Launch with `msfconsole` command.
- Search for an exploit using the `search` command.
    - `search auxiliary`
    - `search auxiliary scanner ssh`
    - `search rank:excellent disclosure_date:2024 Windows`
- Select the exploit using the `use` command.
    - `use auxiliary/dos/http/ws_dos`
    - `use 1599`
- Find more information about an exploit using `info` command.
    - Before selecting, send `info 1599`.
    - After selecting, send `info` command.
- Show all options related to the exploit using `show options` command. Options change depending on the selected exploit.
- Show command can be used in conjunction with other commands such as auxiliary, payloads, exploits, etc.
- To view all the exploits use the `show exploits` command.
- To view all the payloads related to the exploit use the `show payloads` command.
- To leave the context of the exploit use the `back` command.

## Working with modules
- There are 5 different prompts in metasploit.
    - `root@ip-10-10-XX-XX:~#` - Regular command prompt.
    - `msf6 >` - Msfconsole prompt.
    - `msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) >` - Context prompt. Context specific options can be used here.
    - `meterpreter >` - Meterpreter prompt. Meterpreter agent has loaded in the target system and connected back to the attacker's machine.
    - `C:\Windows\system32>` - Shell on the target system. All commands typed here will run on the target system.

## Exploitation
- Select the exploit using the `use` command.
- Show options using `show options` command.
- Set the context specific payload values for the exploit using `set` command.
- Set the global payload values for the exploit using the `setg` command.
- Unset individual values using `unset` or `usetg` command.
- Unset all values using `unset all` or `unsetg all` command.
- Use the `check` command to check if the target is vulnerable. Not all modules support `check`.
- Launch the attack using `exploit` or `run` command.
- Exploit command can be launched in background using `exploit -z` command.
- Send a meterpreter session to background using `background` command. 
- Show all the background sessions using `sessions` command.
- Interact with specific session using `session -i 2` command.
