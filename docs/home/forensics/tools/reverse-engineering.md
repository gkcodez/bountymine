## Frida
- Frida is a powerful instrumentation tool that allows us to analyze, modify, and interact with running applications. Frida creates a thread in the target process; that thread will execute some bootstrap code that allows the interaction. This interaction, known as the agent, permits the injection of JavaScript code, controlling the application's behaviour in real-time.


## IDA, Ghidra, and GDB
- Reverse engineer application.

## ILSpy
- Decompiling binaries.

## PE Studio
- To identify potentially malicious application without executing it.
