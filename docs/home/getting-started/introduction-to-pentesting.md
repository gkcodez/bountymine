## Introduction
- A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. 
- A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

## Penetration Testing Ethics
- Hackers are sorted into three hats, based on their ethics and motivations behind their actions.
  - White hats
  - Grey hats
  - Black hats

### White Hats
- Good hackers.
- Follows rules and use their skills to benefit others.

### Grey Hats
- Does not follow rules all the time.
- Uses their skills to benefit others often.

### Black Hats
- Evil hackers.
- Often seek to damage organizations.

### Rules of Engagement (ROE)
- The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement.
- This document consists of three main sections.
  - **Permission** - This section gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out.
  - **Test Scope** - This section will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. 
  - **Rules** - This section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement.

## Penetration Testing Methodologies
- The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology.
- The steps involved in a typical penetration test are as below
  - Information Gathering
  - Enumeration/Scanning
  - Exploitation
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Post-exploitation

### Information Gathering
- This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target as possible.
- Example: OSINT and research.
- This does not involve scanning any systems.

### Enumeration or Scanning
- This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. 
- For example: Finding open ports, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.

### Exploitation
- This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. 
- This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.

### Privilege Escalation
- After exploitation, privilege escalation is an attempt to expand your access to a system. 
- There are two types of privilege escalations.
  - **Horizontal escalation**: Accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user)
  - **Vertical escalation**: Accessing another permission group (i.e. an administrator).

### Post Exploitation
- This stage includes the following
  - What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting).
  - What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user.
  - Covering your tracks.
  - Reporting.

## OSSTMM
- The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual - https://github.com/mtesauro/owasp-wte/blob/master/temp-projects/wte-docs/contents/usr/share/doc/WTE-Documentation/OSSTMM/OSSTMM.3.pdf
- The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:
  - Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)
  - Wired Networks
  - Wireless communications

## OWASP
- Open Web Application Security Project - https://owasp.org/
- Community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.
- Read about the top 10 vulnerabilities here: https://owasp.org/Top10/

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
- National Institute of Standards and Technology - https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/
- Popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats.

## NCSC CAF
- National Cyber Security Center Cyber Assessment Framework - https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/caf-principles-and-guidance/
- Extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences.


## Principles of Security

### CIA Triad
- The CIA triad is an information security model that is used in consideration throughout creating a security policy.
- The model consists of three sections: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA).
- **Confidentiality** is the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse. 
- **Integrity** is the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made.
- **Availability** is the condition where information should be available when authorised users need to access it.


## Principles of Privileges
- Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals.
  - Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
  - Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- **PIM** is used to translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system.
- **PAM** is the management of the privileges a system's access role has, amongst other things.


## Security Models
- Some popular and effective security models used to achieve the three elements of the CIA triad.
  - The Bell-La Padula Model
  - Biba Model
- The Bell-La Padula Model is used to achieve confidentiality.
- This model uses the rule "no write down, no read up".
- The Bell LaPadula Model is popular within organisations such as governmental and military.
- The Biba model is arguably the equivalent of the Bell-La Padula model but for the integrity of the CIA triad.
- This model uses the rule "no write up, no read down".
- For example: a doctor would not be able to read the notes made by a nurse in a hospital with this model.

## Threat Modelling & Incident Response

### Threat Modelling
- Threat modelling is the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols in place in an organisation's information technology infrastructure and services.
- An effective threat model includes:
  - Threat intelligence
  - Asset identification
  - Mitigation capabilities
  - Risk assessment
- There are frameworks such as STRIDE, to help implementing the threat model.
  - Spoofing identity
  - Tampering with data
  - Repudiation threats
  - Information disclosure
  - Denial of Service 
  - Elevation of privileges

### Incident Response
- A breach of security is known as an incident.
- An incident is responded to by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT).
  - Preparation
  - Identification
  - Containment
  - Eradication
  - Recovery
  - Lessons Learned
